description: Create and revise editable PowerPoint presentations from a brief using HTML slide sources, rendering, and visual review. Use when the requested deliverable is a PPTX deck. The host authors the slides; text-only hosts can use an external visual reviewer.

# PPTAgent

Use the host agent to research and author slides. The CLI handles rendering,
editable conversion, and verification that the delivered PPTX matches the
reviewed sources. Do not start another authoring agent.

## Setup

Resolve `SKILL_ROOT` to this directory. Use its `.venv/bin/python` when present,
otherwise an activated Python 3.11+ environment with the dependencies installed.
Set `SKILL_PYTHON` to that interpreter and run:

```bash
"$SKILL_PYTHON" "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/pptagent.py" doctor --workspace "$PWD"
```

Read [references/task-contract.md](references/task-contract.md) for file layout
and HTML conversion constraints. The default `mode: multimodal` uses the host's
image viewer. Only for `mode: text`, read [references/text.md](references/text.md).
Configuration is optional; defaults live in `config.example.yaml`.
For OpenCode registration and the optional external visual MCP, read
[references/opencode.md](references/opencode.md). When `pptagent-visual` is
connected in text mode, use its `review_slides` and `review_deck` tools instead
of the corresponding CLI commands. They render, review, and record the same
evidence; do not add manual pass records for an external review.

## Create or revise

- Resolve the user's audience, message, page count, language, and aspect ratio.
  For a new workspace, run `init --workspace "$PWD" --slides N`, with optional
  `--aspect-ratio 16:9|4:3|A1` and `--language`. Existing tasks use `task.json`.
- Use available research tools as needed and preserve sources for checkable
  claims. A manuscript or asset manifest is useful for complex decks, not a
  prerequisite for every edit.
- Use `scaffold` if starter HTML is useful; it preserves existing slides.
  Author exactly the requested page count and replace the starter text.
- Run `review-slides` (or the connected MCP tool). In text mode, the external
  reviewer records results automatically. In multimodal mode, inspect every
  returned image, then record each result:

```bash
"$SKILL_PYTHON" "$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/pptagent.py" record-slide-review   --workspace "$PWD" --slide slides/slide01.html --verdict pass   --summary "Readable; no clipping, overlap, or broken images."
```

- Run `build`, then `review-deck` (or the connected MCP tool). In multimodal
  mode, inspect the exported deck's contact sheets, open full-size pages for
  dense content, and record `record-deck-review` with `--verdict` and `--summary`.
  Text mode records visual results automatically.
- Fix issues that affect the user's requirements or visible quality. Source
  changes require fresh renders, reviews, and a build. Shared resource changes
  invalidate all slide reviews. Rendering alone does not establish a pass.
- Run `finalize`. Deliver `answer.pptx` only when `complete=true`. If the user
  explicitly accepts an incomplete draft, set `delivery.mode: best-effort`;
  `delivery_ready=true` then permits delivery with the failed checks disclosed.

Commands take `--workspace` with an absolute path and emit JSON. Use `--help`
for arguments. A successful delivery includes a current `final-report.json`.
Keep API keys in environment variables or the skill's `.env`, outside artifacts.
